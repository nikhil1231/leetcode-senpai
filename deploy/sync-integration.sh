# Keep the leetcode-senpai testing checkout pinned to the head of the
# integration branch. That branch is the cumulative "Testing" stack, rebuilt
# locally by ticket-runner in the main leetcode repo
# (~/Documents/Programming/Learning/leetcode), which is the testing checkout's
# git `origin` -- so we sync from origin, not GitHub.
#
# Default: fetch + hard-reset the checkout to the integration head (+ pip
# install if requirements.txt changed). With --restart, also restart the LAN
# service, but only when the head actually moved. Used both as the service's
# ExecStartPre (no --restart, so a manual/boot start lands on head) and by the
# sync timer (--restart, to pick up new deploys automatically).
#
# This script is served from within the testing checkout at deploy/, so a
# `git reset --hard` restores it rather than losing it.
